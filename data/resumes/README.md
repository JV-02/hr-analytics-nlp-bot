# Resume Samples

This folder contains sample resume files used for NLP experimentation, resume parsing, skills extraction, and chatbot testing. These files are strictly for development and demonstration purposes.

## 1. Source of Data
The resume data used in this project comes from two sources:

1. **Publicly Available Dataset (Kaggle Resume Dataset)**
   - File: `Resume.csv`
   - Contains anonymized resume text and broad job categories.
   - No personal identifying information (PII) is included.

2. **Synthetic Resumes (Optional)**
   - These are manually created or AI-generated for testing.
   - They mimic standard resume structures but do not represent real individuals.

## 2. Data Privacy & GDPR Compliance
To comply with GDPR and general privacy guidelines:

- **No real personal data (PII)** such as names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, photos, or company names are uploaded here.
- If real resumes are ever used locally, they must **not be committed to GitHub**.
- All raw resume files should remain stored **locally only**, unless anonymized.
- Only anonymized text or synthetically generated resume content should be pushed to the public repository.
